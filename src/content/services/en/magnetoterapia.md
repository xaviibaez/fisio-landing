title: 'Magnetotherapy'
shortDescription: 'Therapy with magnetic fields to relieve pain, improve circulation and accelerate healing.'
description: 'Magnetotherapy is based on the theory that magnetic fields can positively affect the human body at the cellular level. Exposure to magnetic fields has various therapeutic effects such as pain relief, improvement of blood circulation, acceleration of the healing process of bone fractures and injured soft tissues, and muscle relaxation.'

## How does Magnetotherapy work?

Magnetotherapy uses low-frequency magnetic fields that penetrate body tissues. These magnetic fields generate very gentle electrical currents that stimulate natural biological processes at the cellular level.

### Mechanism of action:
- **Vasodilation**: Improves blood flow
- **Cellular stimulation**: Accelerates repair processes
- **Anti-inflammatory effect**: Reduces edema and inflammation
- **Analgesia**: Decreases pain perception

## Therapeutic Benefits

### Pain Relief
- Joint pain (arthritis, osteoarthritis)
- Muscle pain and contractures
- Post-traumatic pain
- Chronic pain

### Circulation Improvement
- Stimulation of blood flow
- Improvement of tissue oxygenation
- Reduction of edema
- Prevention of pressure ulcers
