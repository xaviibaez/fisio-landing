## How does Lymphatic Drainage work?

The therapist uses gentle, slow and rhythmic movements on the skin to stimulate lymph flow and improve circulation. Unlike other massages, lymphatic drainage does not use strong pressure, but specific techniques that follow the natural pathway of the lymphatic system.

## Who is it for?

This treatment is especially beneficial for:

- People with fluid retention
- Circulatory problems and heavy legs
- Post-surgical recovery (lipo, mastectomy)
- Reduction of cellulite and localized fat
- Pregnant women (with medical authorization)
- Weakened immune system
- Edemas and lymphedemas

## Functions of the Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system has three main functions in our body:

1. **Elimination of toxins and waste**: Cleanses tissues and eliminates waste substances
2. **Immune defense**: Produces and transports defensive cells
3. **Regulation of fluid balance**: Maintains body water balance
