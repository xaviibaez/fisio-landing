title: 'Pressotherapy'
shortDescription: 'Mechanical massage system to stimulate lymphatic and venous circulation using air chambers.'
description: 'Pressotherapy consists of a pumping system provided by special accessories equipped with air chambers. These chambers inflate alternately pushing fluids from the extremities towards the interior, exerting a mechanical massage that serves to stimulate and make lymphatic and venous circulation more efficient. The device reproduces the controlled compression mechanism simulating a manual lymphatic drainage massage.'

## What is Pressotherapy?

Pressotherapy is a physical therapy that uses air pressure to perform a sequential and controlled massage on the extremities. Through special boots or sleeves divided into different chambers, a progressive compression is applied that follows the natural flow of lymphatic and venous circulation.

## How does it work?

The Pressotherapy device works with a **distoproximal compression** mechanism (from periphery to center):

1. Air chambers inflate sequentially
2. Starts from the distal part (foot/hand) and progresses upwards
3. Each chamber exerts controlled pressure
4. The process repeats in continuous cycles
5. Simulates a manual lymphatic drainage massage

This movement pushes accumulated fluids towards the circulatory system, facilitating their elimination.

## Medical Benefits

### Treatment of Edema and Lymphedema
- Reduction of fluid retention
- Improvement of lymphatic drainage
